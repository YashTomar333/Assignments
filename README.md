Solving some basic problems.
<br>
<p>Q1->  Given an array A [] of n numbers and another number x, the task
         is to check whether or not there exist two elements in A [] whose
         sum is exactly x.<br>
         <br>
    Q2.  Given an array prices[] of length N, representing
         the prices of the stocks on different days, the
         task is to find the maximum profit possible by 
         buying and selling the stocks on different days
         when at most one transaction is allowed.
         Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.<br>
         <br>
    Q3.  Given an array arr[] of n integers, construct a Product Array
         prod[] (of the same size) such that prod[i] is equal to the 
         product of all the elements of arr[] except arr[i].<br>
         <br>
    Q4.  Given a sorted array arr[] (may be distinct or may contain duplicates)
         of size N that is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find
         the minimum element in it.<br>
         <br>
    Q5.  Given an array of N integers where each value
         represents the number of chocolates in a packet.
         Each packet can have a variable number of 
         chocolates. There are m students, the task is
         to distribute chocolate packets such that: <br>
         •	Each student gets one packet.<br>
         •	The difference between the number of chocolates in 
            the packet with maximum chocolates and the packet
            with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum</p>
